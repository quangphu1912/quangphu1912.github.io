  Git Workflow Requirements:
    - Use feature branches for all changes: git checkout develop && git checkout -b <change-name>
    - Work on feature branch, never directly on master or develop
    - Merge feature → develop for testing
    - Test develop branch (switch GitHub Pages temporarily or use local jekyll serve)
    - Merge develop → master only when tested and ready
    - Master auto-deploys to production via GitHub Pages
    - Reference: openspec/specs/git-workflow/spec.md
