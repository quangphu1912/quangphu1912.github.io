## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Quantified business impact

All case studies MUST quantify business impact with specific metrics using the XYZ formula.

#### Scenario: Use XYZ formula for metrics
- **WHEN** business impact is stated
- **THEN** it MUST follow format: "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]"
- **AND** [X] MUST be a specific outcome (e.g., "Reduced latency by 67%")
- **AND** [Y] MUST be a measurable quantity (e.g., "450ms → 150ms")
- **AND** [Z] MUST be the cause (e.g., "by implementing TensorRT optimization")

#### Scenario: Include baseline comparisons
- **WHEN** metrics are presented
- **THEN** they MUST include before/after comparison
- **AND** MUST specify what previous approach was
- **AND** MUST show percentage improvement

#### Scenario: Provide revenue/cost metrics
- **WHEN** business impact includes financial metrics
- **THEN** it MUST quantify in dollars ($X/year saved, $Y revenue increase)
- **AND** MUST specify time period for measurement
- **AND** MUST specify methodology for calculation

#### Scenario: Provide efficiency metrics
- **WHEN** business impact includes efficiency
- **THEN** it MUST quantify time saved (hours/week, days/year)
- **AND** MUST specify what tasks are now automated
- **AND** MUST quantify manual effort eliminated

### Requirement: Model performance metrics

Case studies for ML projects MUST report model performance with specific metrics.

#### Scenario: Report classification metrics
- **WHEN** project uses classification model
- **THEN** it MUST report accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC
- **AND** MUST specify test dataset size and time period
- **AND** MUST compare to baseline model

#### Scenario: Report regression metrics
- **WHEN** project uses regression model
- **THEN** it MUST report MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²
- **AND** MUST specify if predictions are for classification or regression

### Requirement: User feedback and adoption

When applicable, case studies MUST include user feedback or adoption metrics.

#### Scenario: Report adoption metrics
- **WHEN** project has users (internal or external)
- **THEN** it MUST report number of users or adoption rate
- **AND** MUST specify time period for measurement
- **AND** MAY include user testimonials or quotes

#### Scenario: Report user satisfaction
- **WHEN** user feedback is available
- **THEN** it MUST report satisfaction score (e.g., NPS, 1-5 rating)
- **AND** MUST include number of respondents
