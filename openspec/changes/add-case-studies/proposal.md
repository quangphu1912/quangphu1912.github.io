## Why

Projects lack detailed case studies showing business impact, technical challenges, and quantified results. For senior roles, recruiters need to see the journey from business problem → technical solution → measurable outcomes, not just project descriptions. The current portfolio has vague claims like "drove strategic initiatives" without metrics. Case studies will demonstrate full-stack ML competence, business acumen, and ability to drive measurable impact.

## What Changes

- **Create detailed case study pages** for each project with standardized sections:
  - Executive Summary (150 words)
  - Business Challenge (stakeholder pain points, success metrics, constraints)
  - Technical Approach (architecture diagrams, data pipeline, model selection, key decisions)
  - Implementation Journey (timeline, challenges, iterations, team collaboration)
  - Results & Impact (business metrics, model metrics, user feedback, screenshots)
  - Lessons Learned (what worked, what to do differently, applicability)
  - Future Roadmap (planned improvements, scaling opportunities)
- **Add architecture diagrams** using Mermaid syntax for visual representation
- **Quantify all impact** with specific metrics (e.g., "Reduced latency by 67%", "Saved $50K/year")
- **Create case study template** for future projects
- **Link from project pages** to detailed case studies

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `project-case-studies`: Comprehensive documentation of business challenges, technical solutions, and measurable impact
- `architecture-documentation`: Mermaid diagrams showing data flows, ML pipelines, and system architecture
- `impact-measurement**: Quantified business and model metrics demonstrating ROI
- `implementation-storytelling`: Narrative format showing journey from problem to solution

### Modified Capabilities

None (new pages added to portfolio, no changes to existing project behavior)

## Impact

- **New pages**: /case-studies/aws-pipeline/, /case-studies/sentiment-analysis/, /case-studies/churn-prediction/
- **Updated files**: Add case study links to _projects/*.md and projects.md
- **New template**: _layouts/case-study.html for consistent formatting
- **Visual improvements**: Mermaid diagrams in markdown for architecture visualization
- **Career impact**: Demonstrates business acumen, technical depth, and ability to drive measurable outcomes
