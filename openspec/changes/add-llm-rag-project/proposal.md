## Why

The portfolio lacks modern ML project diversity. LLMs and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) are the hottest skills in 2024, but the current portfolio has zero LLM experience. Adding an LLM/RAG project will modernize the portfolio, demonstrate ability to work with cutting-edge technology, and provide a complete end-to-end system (vector DB, embeddings, LLM orchestration, UI). This addresses a critical gap and differentiates the candidate from competitors.

## What Changes

- **Create new LLM/RAG project**: "Financial Document Q&A System"
- **Tech stack**: LangChain + OpenAI API (or local LLM) + Pinecone/Weaviate vector DB + Streamlit UI
- **Features**:
  - Document ingestion (PDF, TXT) with chunking strategies
  - Vector embeddings using OpenAI Ada or HuggingFace models
  - Retrieval with semantic search
  - Generation with LLM (GPT-4 or local model)
  - Streamlit web interface for queries
  - Evaluation framework using RAGAS metrics
  - Cost tracking for API calls
- **Deliverables**:
  - Complete working application
  - GitHub repo with setup instructions
  - Architecture diagram
  - Blog post: "Building RAG Systems: A Practical Guide"
  - Model card and performance benchmarks
- **Project page** on portfolio with screenshots and demo link

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `llm-applications`: End-to-end LLM application with LangChain orchestration
- `vector-databases`: Semantic search using Pinecone/Weaviate with embeddings
- `rag-pipelines`: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with document chunking and retrieval strategies
- `streaming-ui`: Interactive web interface using Streamlit for real-time Q&A
- `ml-evaluation`: RAGAS metrics for measuring retrieval and generation quality
- `cost-optimization`: Tracking and optimizing LLM API costs

### Modified Capabilities

None (new project added to portfolio, no changes to existing projects)

## Impact

- **New project**: Complete LLM/RAG application in new GitHub repo
- **Portfolio additions**: _projects/llm-rag-qa.md, project screenshots, demo link
- **Blog post**: Technical deep-dive on RAG implementation
- **Demonstrated skills**: LLMs, vector DBs, RAG, LangChain, modern ML stack
- **Career impact**: Positions candidate as cutting-edge practitioner, attracts ML engineer roles
- **Time investment**: 2-3 weeks for full implementation with documentation
